# Purchasing-Oversight

Tools: Python, SQL, Tableau, ChatGPT, and Excel

In my current role, I identified a gap in monitoring purchases, which posed risks such as unauthorized side work, inaccuarate cost tracking, and outdated pricing. While exploring purchasing data, I realized I could provide valuable insights across multiple departments if properly structured and anallyzed. 

To illustrate this, I created a simulated invoice system. Using Python and chatGPT, I genarated realistic but clearly fake invoices, complete with vendor names inspired by my pets. I then used Excel to clean the data and create fictional work orders, featuring TV characters as customers. After building the necessary database, I used SQL for data structuring and analysis, and Tableau to create visulaizations.

This proof of concept demonstrates analyzing purchasing data can provide valuable insights to multiple departments.

  Managers can track technician purchases, negotiate better pricing from their venders, analyze cost of goods sold, and make educated decisions when it comes to stocked items.

  Field Technicians can offer competitive, profitable estimates while helping other departments better understand their purchasing behaviors.

  Accounts Payable benefits from saving time during invoice entry, simplified statement reconciliation, and added value from a team who is jokingly referred to as, "The people     who spend my money."
